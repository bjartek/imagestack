A small javascript experient. 
For all images in a div
 - place randomly
 - rotate some
 - stack one atop of another.

When clicking an image or using 0-9 in keyboard
 - animate image to front and reorder z-index for other images


Far from perfect, Need to do some "when all images are loaded trick" to get the random placement correct.

Images and some of the idea from:
